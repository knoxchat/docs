## üéØ What's New?

### Smart Tab Navigation
The models page now features four distinct tabs, each designed for specific use cases:

#### üè† **Default Tab**
- Browse our complete catalog of AI models
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Sort by newest, oldest, price, or context length
- Perfect for exploring all available options

#### üèÜ **Top 10 Tab**  
- Discover the most popular models on [knox.chat](https://knox.chat)
- Intelligent ranking system based on real user data
- **Ranking Methodology**: Automatically calculated using:
  - User adoption rates and total usage volume
  - Average usage frequency across the platform  
  - Average consumption patterns and cost efficiency
- Dynamic rankings that reflect current platform trends
- *Note: Rankings are for reference only and represent one perspective of model popularity*
- Great for finding proven, community-validated models

#### üîß **Tool Calling Tab**
- Dedicated section for models that support function calling
- Filter between models that support or don't support tool calling
- Essential for developers building AI agents and automated workflows
- Includes models like `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` and other tool-enabled models

#### üéÅ **Free Models Tab**
- Exclusive view of all free-tier models
- Real-time free usage tracking and limits
- Perfect for testing, learning, and budget-conscious users
- Examples: `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` and other free variants

## üöÄ Enhanced Features

### Persistent Tab State
- Your selected tab is remembered across page refreshes

- **Data-Driven Rankings**: Our Top 10 list is automatically generated using comprehensive platform analytics
- **Multi-Factor Algorithm**: Combines user adoption, usage frequency, and consumption efficiency
- **Real-Time Updates**: Rankings refresh regularly to reflect current platform trends

### Real-Time Usage Tracking

## üåü Why This Matters

- **Clarity**: Clear categorization helps users make informed decisions
- **Transparency**: Real-time usage tracking for free tier users
