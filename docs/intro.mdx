# Quickstart

**Knox Chat**: provides a unified API that allows you to access hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Our goal is not merely to provide a single API for accessing multiple models, but also to focus on multimodality and enable convenient usage of today's popular open-source AI or agent applications and tools with just one key.

## Using the OpenAI SDK

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts showLineNumbers
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://knox.chat/v1',
  apiKey: '<KNOXCHAT_API_KEY>',
});

async function main() {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
}

main();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://knox.chat/v1",
  api_key="<KNOXCHAT_API_KEY>",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-5",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using the Knox.Chat API directly

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
  url="https://knox.chat/v1/chat/completions",
  headers={
    "Authorization": "Bearer <KNOXCHAT_API_KEY>",
  },
  data=json.dumps({
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5", # Optional
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ]
  })
)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts showLineNumbers
fetch('https://knox.chat/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer <KNOXCHAT_API_KEY>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
      },
    ],
  }),
});

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sh" label="Shell">

```sh showLineNumbers
curl https://knox.chat/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KNOXCHAT_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The API also supports streaming.

## Using third-party SDKs

For information about using third-party SDKs and frameworks with Knox Chat, please see our frameworks documentation.

## Principles

Knox Chat helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multimodality and multi-provider.

### Why Knox Chat?

Price and Performance. Knox Chat scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to prioritize them.

Standardized API. No need to change code when switching between models or providers. You can even let your users choose and pay for their own.

Real-World Insights. Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of how often models are used for different purposes. Keep up to date in our Discord channel.

Consolidated Billing. Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.

Higher Availability. Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.

Higher Rate Limits. Knox Chat works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.

## Models

One API for hundreds of models

Explore and browse [**300+ models**](https://knox.chat/models) and providers on our website, or with our [API](/1.0.0/list-available-models).

### Models API Standard

Our Models API makes the most important information about all LLMs freely available as soon as we confirm it.

### API Response Schema

The Models API returns a standardized JSON response format that provides comprehensive metadata for each available model. This schema is cached at the edge and designed for reliable integration for production applications.

### Root Response Object

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "data": [
    /* Array of Model objects */
  ]
}
```

### Model Object Schema

Each model in the `data` array contains the following standardized fields:

| Field                  | Type                                          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                   | `string`                                      | Unique model identifier used in API requests (e.g., `"google/gemini-2.5-pro"`)       |
| `object`               | `string`                                      | Object type identifier (always `"model"`)                                             |
| `created`              | `number`                                      | Unix timestamp of when the model was created                                          |
| `owned_by`             | `string`                                      | Organization that owns the model                                                       |
| `permission`           | `ModelPermission[]`                           | Array of permission objects defining access controls                                   |
| `root`                 | `string`                                      | Root model identifier                                                                  |
| `parent`               | `string \| null`                              | Parent model identifier if this is a fine-tuned version                               |
| `context_length`       | `number`                                      | Maximum context window size in tokens                                                 |
| `architecture`         | `Architecture`                                | Object describing the model's technical capabilities                                   |
| `pricing`              | `Pricing`                                     | Price structure for using this model                                                  |
| `top_provider`         | `TopProvider`                                 | Configuration details for the primary provider                                        |
| `supported_parameters` | `string[]`                                    | Array of supported API parameters for this model                                      |
#### Architecture Object

```typescript showLineNumbers
{
  "modality": string, // High-level description of input/output flow (e.g., "text+image->text")
  "input_modalities": string[], // Supported input types: ["file", "image", "text", "audio"]
  "output_modalities": string[], // Supported output types: ["text"]
  "tokenizer": string // Tokenization method used (e.g., "Gemini")
}
```

#### Pricing Object

All pricing values are in USD per token/request/unit. A value of `"0"` indicates the feature is free.

```typescript showLineNumbers
{
  "prompt": string, // Cost per input token
  "completion": string, // Cost per output token
  "request": string, // Fixed cost per API request
  "image": string, // Cost per image input
  "audio": string, // Cost per audio input
  "web_search": string, // Cost per web search operation
  "internal_reasoning": string, // Cost for internal reasoning tokens
  "input_cache_read": string, // Cost per cached input token read
  "input_cache_write": string // Cost per cached input token write
}
```

#### Top Provider Object

```typescript showLineNumbers
{
  "context_length": number, // Provider-specific context limit
  "max_completion_tokens": number // Maximum tokens in response
}
```

#### Supported Parameters

The `supported_parameters` array indicates which OpenAI-compatible parameters work with each model:

* `include_reasoning` - Include reasoning in response
* `max_tokens` - Response length limiting
* `reasoning` - Internal reasoning mode
* `response_format` - Output format specification
* `seed` - Deterministic outputs
* `stop` - Custom stop sequences
* `structured_outputs` -  JSON schema enforcement
* `temperature` - Randomness control
* `tool_choice` - Tool selection control
* `tools` - Function calling capabilities
* `top_p` - Nucleus sampling

:::note Token Counting Differences
Different models use different tokenization methods (as indicated by the `tokenizer` field in the model schema). Some models break up text into chunks of multiple characters (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc), while others tokenize differently (like Gemini). This means that token counts (and therefore costs) will vary between models, even when inputs and outputs are the same. Costs are displayed and billed according to the tokenizer for the model in use. You can use the `usage` field in API responses to get the actual token counts for your input and output.

    <AccordionItem value="item-2">
      <AccordionTrigger>How frequently are new models added</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        We work on adding models as quickly as we can. We often have partnerships with the labs releasing models and can release models as soon as they are available. 
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value="item-3">
      <AccordionTrigger>What are model variants?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        Variants are suffixes that can be added to the model slug to change its behavior.

        Static variants can only be used with specific models and these are listed in our [models api](https://knox.chat/v1/models).

        1. `:free` - The model is always provided for free and has low rate limits.
        2. `:beta` - The model is not moderated by Knox Chat.
        3. `:extended` - The model has longer than usual context length.
        4. `:thinking` - The model supports reasoning by default.

        Dynamic variants can be used on all models and they change the behavior of how the request is routed or used.

        1. `:online` - All requests will run a query to extract web results that are attached to the prompt.
        2. `:nitro` - Providers will be sorted by throughput rather than the default sort, optimizing for faster response times.
        3. `:floor` - Providers will be sorted by price rather than the default sort, prioritizing the most cost-effective options.
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value="item-5">
      <AccordionTrigger>What is the expected latency/response time for different models?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        For each model on Knox Chat we show the latency (time to first token) and the token throughput for all providers. You can use this to estimate how long requests will take. If you would like to optimize for throughput you can use the `:nitro` variant to route to the fastest provider.
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value="item-6">
      <AccordionTrigger>How does model fallback work if a provider is unavailable?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        If a provider returns an error Knox Chat will automatically fall back to the next provider. This happens transparently to the user and allows production apps to be much more resilient. Knox Chat has a lot of options to configure the provider routing behavior. The full documentation can be found [here](/model-routing).
