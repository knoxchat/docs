### 8. Multi-turn Image Context

**Use previous images as context** for seamless editing workflows.

| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-23.png) |
|-|

#### Context Modes:

| Mode | Description | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **No Context** | Fresh generation | Starting new image |
| **Use Previous One** | Last image as context | Continuing single edit |
| **Use Previous Ten** | Last 10 images as context | Complex multi-image edits |

#### How It Works:

When you enable context:
1. AI receives previous image(s) automatically
2. Your edit applies to those images
3. Creates edited version maintaining consistency

#### How to Use:

**Enable Context:**
1. Look for "Image Context" selector (next to Aspect Ratio)
2. Choose your mode
3. Type your edit
4. AI applies to context images

**Example Workflow:**
```
Turn 1: "Portrait of a man in a suit"
→ Context: No Context
Note: Select Aspect Ratio 2:3 -> 832x1248 for best practice
```
| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-24.png) |
|-|

```
Turn 2: "Make the suit blue"
→ Context: Use Previous One
→ AI edits the existing portrait
```
| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-25.png) |
|-|

```
Turn 3: "Add a hat"
→ Context: Use Previous One
→ AI adds hat to the blue suit version
```
| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-26.png) |
|-|

```
Turn 4: "Create 3 variations"
→ Context: Use Previous One
→ AI creates 3 variations maintaining style
```
| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-27.png) |
|-|

#### Advanced Use:

**"Use Previous Ten" Mode:**
- For batch processing
- Maintaining consistent style across series
- Complex multi-step edits

**Pro Tip:** Context includes both:
- AI-generated images
- User-uploaded images
- But NOT user text prompts (clean slate each time!)

### 9. Aspect Ratio Control

| ![](/img/image-generation/ai-img-28.png) |
|-|

**10 aspect ratios** optimized for different use cases.

#### Available Ratios:

| Ratio | Dimensions | Best For |
