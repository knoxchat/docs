## 5. International Data Transfers

When you access our website or Service, your personal data may be transferred to our servers on Amazon Web Services (AWS) N. Virginia (us-east-1), or to other countries outside the United States. This may be a direct transfer of personal data you provide to us, or a transfer made by us or third parties. When information is transferred outside the United States, we ensure it is adequately protected legally by relying on: (1) adequacy decisions made by the European Commission under Article 45 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where they recognize that countries outside the EEA provide an adequate level of data protection, and (2) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission under Article 46 of the GDPR, which allow websites within the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA.

## 6. Data Retention

We are bound by applicable information retention laws and will retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary to comply with our business and legal obligations and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. When personal data we collect is no longer needed by us, we and our service providers will follow procedures to destroy, delete, erase, or convert it to anonymous form as permitted or required by applicable law.

## 7. Your Choices About Personal Data

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal data you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

### Opting Out of Marketing and Advertising Communications

If we have sent you a promotional email, you may opt out of receiving such emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in such emails. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service experience, or other transactions.

### Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Data

You may review and change your personal data by sending us an email. You may also be able to access and update your personal data by logging in to the website and visiting your account profile page.

We cannot delete your personal data except by deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

We can only delete your personal data by deleting your user account. Once you delete your user account, you will not be able to recover it. If you want to delete your user account, please contact us via email.

### Data Accuracy

We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data we process remains accurate and up-to-date. However, it is your responsibility to update any changes.

We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

If you no longer want to use our Service, or no longer want your personal data to be processed, you may request deletion of your account and information in your account by sending us an email, subject to certain limitations. Once you submit a request, we will send an email to the email address associated with your account asking you to confirm the deletion request. Once you confirm your request to delete your account and data, your account will be inaccessible during the time we process your request. This process cannot be canceled, revoked, withdrawn, or reversed once you confirm the request. When your account is deleted, all related personal data will be deleted unless we need to retain it for regulatory and compliance purposes or out of legal or business necessity.
