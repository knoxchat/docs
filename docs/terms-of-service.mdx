# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** August 15, 2025

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in Knox Chat ("**Knox.Chat**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") and our website located at https://knox.chat (the "**Website**"), as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the "**Service**"). These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Knox Chat regarding your use of the Service.

Please read the following terms carefully. By creating an account or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions, including Knox Chat's Privacy Policy (collectively, the "**Terms**"). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.

These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Knox Chat will be resolved by binding arbitration. You agree that your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review Section 17 ("Dispute Resolution and Arbitration") for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Knox Chat.

## 1. Knox Chat Service Overview

Knox Chat operates a large language model aggregator that enables users to access various generative artificial intelligence models ("**AI Models**") through third-party application programming interfaces ("**APIs**") via our Website. Knox Chat may add or remove AI Models from the Service at any time at our sole discretion.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are under 18 years old, you must have your parent's or legal guardian's permission to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that organization.

## 3. Account and Registration

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us or our identity authentication platform with some information about yourself, such as your email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us through the footer email.

## 4. Payment Terms

### 4.1 Prepaid Credits and Refunds

Access to the Service or certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees for prepaid top-ups linked to your account, as well as payment processing and transaction fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Currently, Knox Chat requires users to top up credits to make API calls and access the Service, with minimum and maximum purchase amounts of ¥100 and ¥100,000 respectively per transaction. After top-up, any unused balance becomes non-refundable once model service calls have been made. To request a refund during the eligible period, you must email Knox Chat through the footer email address.

### 4.2 Credit Expiration

Knox Chat reserves the right to expire top-up balances that remain unused for three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the top-up date.

### 4.3 Currency and Payment Processing

Knox Chat will charge your payment method specified at the time of top-up. You authorize Knox Chat to charge such payment method for all amounts described in these Terms for your selected Service.

### 4.4 Fee Changes

If Knox Chat changes the fees for the Service, including adding additional fees or charges, Knox Chat will provide advance notice of these changes. If you do not accept the changes, Knox Chat may discontinue providing the Service to you.

## 5. User Content

### 5.1 User Content Overview and Training Data

You may provide input to the Service, which may include images, data, text, and other types of content ("**Input**"), and receive output from the Service based on your Input ("**Output**", and Input and Output collectively referred to as "**User Content**"). You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in your Input. Your ownership rights in Output are governed by the terms of each AI Model you use ("**AI Model Terms**"), a list of which is provided here. While we strive to keep the AI Model Terms current each time we add or remove each AI Model from the Service, there may be inaccurate or missing terms. If you notice any terms linked to an AI Model that are inaccurate, missing, or outdated, you may contact us via email. Knox Chat strives to accurately represent the prompt logging and training status of each AI Model on our website. However, Knox Chat is not responsible for errors or misrepresentations in any AI Model Terms. You are advised to review the AI Model Terms yourself as needed. We do not use any data content you input to provide data to model providers for model training, except for free models with [variant](/provider-routing#nitro-shortcut) `:free`.
