# Zero Completion Insurance

Knox Chat provides zero-output generation protection, ensuring users are not charged for failed or empty responses. If the response contains no output tokens and the generation reason is empty or an error occurs, you will not be charged for that requestâ€”even if the underlying provider imposes rapid processing fees.
## How It Works

Zero-output generation protection is automatically applied to all requests across all models and providers. Your account will not be debited for any fees if the response meets any of the following conditions:

* The response contains zero output tokens, and the generation reason is blank/empty.
* The response includes an error as the generation reason.

## Viewing Protected Requests

On your Knox Chat account [**Activity**](https://knox.chat/activity) page, requests protected by zero-output generation insurance will show a deduction of zero.
